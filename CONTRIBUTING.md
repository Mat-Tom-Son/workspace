# Contributing to Workspace

Thanks for helping make folder-based computer work more understandable and more capable.

## Start with the product model

Before changing navigation, terminology, storage, trust, or Assistant behavior, read:

- [Product model and roadmap](docs/product-model.md)
- [Assistant capabilities](docs/assistant-capabilities.md)
- [Architecture](docs/architecture.md)
- [Workspace management layer](docs/management-layer.md)
- [Workspace contributor guide](AGENTS.md) — the canonical policy for Codex and every contributor.
- [Claude Code entrypoint](CLAUDE.md) — imports `AGENTS.md` rather than duplicating it.

The central constraint is that a Space remains an ordinary folder. Workspace may register and present that folder, but should not silently move, convert, decorate, upload, or place all of its contents into Assistant context.

## Report an issue

Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Mat-Tom-Son/workspace/issues) for reproducible bugs and focused feature proposals. Include the Workspace version, Windows version, what you expected, what happened, and the smallest safe reproduction you can provide.

Do not put API keys, tokens, private file contents, personal paths, or security vulnerabilities in a public issue. Follow [the security policy](SECURITY.md) for vulnerabilities.

## Develop locally

Workspace requires Node 22.19.0 or newer.

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Mat-Tom-Son/workspace.git
cd workspace
npm install
npm run local:dev
```

Keep changes focused and avoid committing generated `dist/`, `out/`, user-data, credential, or signing files.

## Codex and Claude Code parity

Codex reads the root `AGENTS.md` directly. Claude Code reads the tracked root `CLAUDE.md`, which imports `AGENTS.md` with `@AGENTS.md`. Update shared rules only in `AGENTS.md`; do not create a parallel harness-specific build, test, release, terminology, or architecture contract.

Both harnesses can inspect an installed app through `workspace ... --json`. To drive one real Assistant turn through the development local API and native Pi runtime:

```powershell
npm run workspace:drive -- --workspace C:\path\to\space --prompt "Summarize this Space"
npm run workspace:drive -- --workspace C:\path\to\space --prompt "..." --json --agent-dir C:\temp\isolated-pi
```

Use the installed CLI for read-only management snapshots and `workspace:drive` for an end-to-end Pi turn. See [Workspace management layer](docs/management-layer.md) for their different boundaries.

## Verify a change

Use the smallest relevant lane while working, then promote the change before handoff:

```powershell
npm run check
npm test
npm run desktop:prepare
```

Use `npm run desktop:package:smoke` when packaged behavior or assets change. It verifies the canonical unpacked release layout without building an NSIS installer. Use `npm run desktop:make` only for an installer/release candidate. The purpose of each lane is explained in [Windows build](docs/windows-build.md).

Add or update tests for behavior changes. Update README and focused docs when a change affects shipped behavior, terminology, privacy, security, trust, build commands, or the roadmap.

For kernel or CLI changes, update the snapshot/protocol version deliberately and exercise the kernel, adapter, protocol, broker, desktop-host, and installer-packaging tests through `npm test`. Keep the README, management guide, Security, and Privacy output descriptions in sync. Protocol v1 must remain read-only.

## Pull requests

A useful pull request:

- Explains the user outcome and the problem it solves.
- Keeps internal compatibility names separate from user-facing Space and Library language.
- Identifies data, scope, context, and trust changes explicitly.
- Preserves Pi's native resource behavior instead of adding a parallel format.
- Includes relevant test and verification results.
- Calls out remaining risk or follow-up work without presenting roadmap items as shipped.

Maintainers publish releases from clean version tags. Contributors should not rewrite a released tag or replace artifacts beneath an existing version.

The full maintainer sequence—local candidate, green main CI, exact annotated tag, tagged release workflow, public asset verification, and installed updater smoke—is documented in [Windows releases and signing](docs/windows-release.md).
