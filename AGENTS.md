# Workspace contributor guide

Workspace is a local-first Electron shell around ordinary folders and the native Pi agent runtime. Read [the product model](docs/product-model.md) before changing navigation, terminology, storage, trust, or Assistant behavior, and read [the management layer](docs/management-layer.md) before changing the kernel, CLI, task registry, or an agent-facing adapter. These documents record the shared product and control-plane direction; update them when those decisions change.

## Harness parity

- This `AGENTS.md` is the one canonical contributor contract. Codex reads it directly; Claude Code reads the root `CLAUDE.md`, which imports this file with `@AGENTS.md`.
- Edit shared policy here instead of copying it into `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.codex/`, or harness-specific prose. Keep the root Claude entrypoint thin so the two harnesses cannot drift.
- Both harnesses use the same checked-in npm scripts, documentation, test suites, and release lanes. Do not create alternate Claude-only or Codex-only build or release commands.
- `workspace <command> --json`—for example, `workspace context --json`—is the stable installed-product inspection surface for any shell-capable harness. `npm run workspace:drive` is the separate real-Pi-turn test driver; do not conflate it with the read-only management CLI.
- The harness-loading conventions are documented by [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/guides/agents-md) and [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/memory). Repository behavior is defined here.

## Product boundaries

- Use **Workspace** as the user-facing product name.
- A **Space** is a human-friendly working context backed by one ordinary folder. Registering an existing folder must not move, copy, or rename user files. Workspace deliberately maintains hidden, portable `.workspace/space.json` identity metadata and `.workspace/conversations/` logs in that folder.
- The folder is transparent infrastructure, not a proprietary container. Keep **Show folder** and normal filesystem interoperability intact.
- Use **Library** only for passive, reusable personal materials. Library items enter a Space through an explicit copy and never become Assistant context automatically.
- Use **Capability** as the navigation umbrella. Inside it, use **Skill** for a reusable way of working and **Extension** for executable Pi capabilities or connections. Packages are distribution and lifecycle plumbing, not another top-level product concept.
- Keep package, protocol, IPC, updater, user-data, and environment identifiers independent and product-neutral.
- Keep provider credentials, Space registrations, History objects, Pi sessions, ignore rules, and machine-specific application state outside user content folders. Only the documented portable `.workspace/` records belong in a Space.
- Treat project Pi resources—including `.pi` and other Pi-supported project locations—as executable configuration. Successfully creating or registering a Space is Workspace's authorization to load that folder's local Pi configuration; removing the Space revokes that Workspace authorization. Do not add a second trust prompt for the same act.
- Prefer Pi's built-in tools, resource loader, auth storage, model registry, package manager, skills, and extensions over app-specific replacements.
- Keep agent-created restricted apps in their separate reviewed-web lane. They use `agent-app.json`, digest-pinned installation, sandboxed Electron hosts, and narrow host brokers; they must never be installed through Pi's package manager or merged into Pi's loaded Extension catalog.
- Do not bundle proprietary tools, instructions, source libraries, or account integrations.
- Do not describe a desktop-synchronized folder as native cloud integration. Google Drive currently works through Google Drive for desktop; direct Drive APIs and native provider OAuth are future adapter work.

## Product rails

- **Local first:** a Space remains useful as a folder without an account or cloud service.
- **Understandable:** explain outcomes in terms of Spaces, Library materials, and Capabilities; identify Skills and Extensions inside that surface, and reveal technical paths and package sources as supporting detail.
- **Explicit context:** registering a Space, adding or copying materials, installing packages, granting connections, and attaching files are distinct actions. Do not silently put files or capabilities into a conversation.
- **Understandable authorization:** creating or registering a Space authorizes its local Pi configuration without a redundant trust ceremony. Package review, restricted-app permissions, connection credentials, and Chat context remain separate grants, and removing the Space must revoke Workspace's project-runtime authorization.
- **Portable identity:** `.workspace/` is data, not executable configuration. Preserve a valid manifest id when a Space folder moves, hide `.workspace/` and `.pi/` from Files, and exclude both from History capture.
- **Space-bound tabs:** every surface tab owns a Space id. Activating a tab activates that Space; switching Spaces restores that Space's most recent tab. Never make a tab silently inherit whichever Space happens to be selected.
- **Background continuity:** inactive Chat tabs stay mounted while their turns run. Tab switches, taskbar minimization, sleep/wake recovery, and close-to-tray must not cancel an accepted turn or lose its persisted result; only an explicit stop or quit may do that.
- **Native Pi compatibility:** preserve standard `SKILL.md` directories and Pi scopes. Do not fork a Workspace-only skill or extension format.
- **General computer work:** avoid code-only assumptions in primary UI copy and workflows.
- **Layered app authority:** proposing, reviewing, installing, granting one destination/file/notification category, saving a connection, and enabling each named automation are distinct actions. Revocation must stop stale launches before authority changes take effect.

## Stable information architecture

The rail starts with the **Space** selector, followed by **Files**, **Capabilities**, **Chats**, **Library**, and **History**. **Shortcuts** and **Settings** stay at the bottom. Capabilities combines Skills and Extensions into one Installed/Discover surface; package source, scope, type, load state, diagnostics, update, and removal remain visible inside it. Installed Space apps appear in their contributed rail region, while Capabilities owns their grants, connections, named automations and run history, local data, update review, and removal. Model-provider, model, API-key, and provider-OAuth setup belongs in **Settings → Assistant**, not in the rail. Restricted-app connection grants and OAuth setup belong with that app in **Capabilities**. User-facing copy uses **Space** and **Library** even where internal routes or types retain `workspace`, `project`, or `resource` for compatibility.

See [Assistant capabilities](docs/assistant-capabilities.md) for the scopes, trust model, Anthropic-compatible skill import behavior, package boundary, and distinction between Library materials and Pi resources.
Read [Restricted app runtime](docs/restricted-app-runtime.md) and [Restricted app authoring](docs/restricted-app-authoring.md) before changing `agent-app.json`, app proposals, sandbox hosts, bridges, brokers, credentials, storage, notifications, named automation scheduling, or contributed app navigation.

## Workspace management layer

- `WorkspaceKernel` is the shared in-process read authority for versioned Space context, registered Spaces, active Assistant/compaction tasks, and Pi capability snapshots. The renderer/local API and CLI must consume the same semantic source rather than recreate selection or catalog rules.
- Every query carries an explicit actor. An explicit Space id wins; otherwise context resolves to the deepest registered Space containing the actor's current directory; otherwise it resolves to none.
- Keep adapters thin. The CLI projection intentionally emits compact, content-free summaries, while domain services continue to own mutations, trust, filesystem policy, History, and concurrency controls.
- Protocol v1 under `%APPDATA%\Workspace\cli` is same-user coordination, not an authenticated caller boundary. It must remain read-only. Mutations require a separately versioned authenticated transport, authorization and replay design, explicit scope, and durable receipts.
- Start and finish kernel task records on every Assistant-turn and Chat-compaction path, including errors and abort cleanup. Never leave ghost tasks or let a capability mutation interrupt active work.
- Treat snapshot versions and `--json` output as compatibility contracts. Update implementation, adapters, tests, [the management guide](docs/management-layer.md), README, security, and privacy documentation together when they change.

## Development

- Use Node 22.19.0 or newer.
- Run `npm run check` after TypeScript changes.
- Run `npm test` before handing off behavior changes.
- Use the smallest verification lane that can catch the failure you are working on; do not make an installer during every inner-loop UI change.
- Run `npm run desktop:prepare` after Electron, packaging, or runtime-resource changes, and before handing off a desktop-integrated change. The composed package and installer commands already include it.
- Run `npm run desktop:package:smoke` when packaged behavior or installer-facing assets change. It verifies the canonical Electron Builder layout without spending time on the NSIS installer.
- Run the slower Forge-based `npm run desktop:package` only when diagnosing or changing that retained package lane.
- Run `npm run desktop:make` only for an installer/release candidate; it already includes `desktop:verify:release`. Run the verifier alone only when rechecking existing `out/builder` artifacts.
- On macOS, use Node 24 and run `npm run desktop:make:mac` for the complete ad hoc structural smoke candidate. That lane uses `Workspace Local Smoke` with a separate bundle id and updater-disabled runtime; never rename or install it over `Workspace.app`, and do interactive release-workstation testing only with a Developer ID-signed candidate or a disposable macOS account. Use `npm run desktop:make:mac:release` for a signed candidate and `npm run desktop:release:mac` for the guarded build-and-publish lane; both release commands require the Developer ID identity and notarization profile documented in `docs/macos-release.md`.
- When changing the management layer or CLI, run the kernel, adapter, protocol, broker, desktop-host, and packaging suites through `npm test`; add focused coverage for every new snapshot or command.
- Never commit provider keys, signing material, tokens, or generated user data.
- Publish Windows releases only after the release commit is pushed to `main` and its CI run is green, then create a clean `v<package version>` tag pointing at that exact commit. Required assets are the installer, blockmap, `latest.yml`, and checksums from one build.
- Mac automatic updates use the separate public `Mat-Tom-Son/workspace-mac-releases` feed. Keep the package version shared with Windows, preserve `io.github.mattomson.workspace` and `workspace-desktop-updater`, and do not move Mac artifacts into the Windows release publisher or create competing tag jobs.
- If a legacy ad hoc Mac build causes repeated Keychain prompts, use `npm run desktop:reset:mac-safe-storage -- --yes --reopen` only after Workspace is fully quit. Never request the Safe Storage secret with `security ... -g`; that diagnostic can itself prompt. The reset may remove provider/restricted-app credentials but must preserve Spaces and ordinary app data.
- Keep personal PFX files outside the repository and use only the `WIN_CSC_LINK` and `WIN_CSC_KEY_PASSWORD` GitHub secrets. Do not reuse organization signing credentials.
- Keep README claims and the docs in sync with shipped behavior. In particular, do not claim native Google Drive, provider OAuth, package lifecycle controls, or public signing until the corresponding user path is verified.

The verification ladder and release boundaries are documented in [Windows build](docs/windows-build.md), [Windows releases and signing](docs/windows-release.md), [macOS build and release lane](docs/macos-build.md), and [macOS release runbook](docs/macos-release.md). The control-plane boundary and real-agent driver are documented in [Workspace management layer](docs/management-layer.md).
