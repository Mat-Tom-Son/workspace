# App platform foundation

> **Status:** Accepted product and architecture direction; local App Studio and

>
> **Scope:** This document is the normative foundation for evolving restricted

Workspace is both a local studio and a runtime surface. A person and the
Assistant work in an ordinary folder-backed Space, may explicitly declare an App
Project there, and may build reviewed Features that contribute pages, actions,
data, connections, and named automations. Publication closes selected reviewed
material into an immutable App Release. Workspace 0.4 ships that lifecycle
locally: prepare, separately publish, install in a chosen Space, update or roll
back, and uninstall with an explicit data choice. It does not ship upload,
hosted deployment, sync, accounts, discovery, or an App Store.

This direction resolves the original “should Spaces be Apps?” question by
keeping the useful distinction:

- a **Space** is the general local working context and may never become an App;
- an **App Project** is an optional source-and-publication role declared by one
  Space;
- a **Feature** is one stable contribution to that Project, such as the current
  reviewed sidebar app;
- an **App Release** is immutable reviewed distribution content; and
- an **App Instance** is one release-backed local installation or hosted
  deployment with mutable data and authority.

`Runtime Instance` is internal contract language, not a third product object. It
is a discriminated union with one opaque `runtimeInstanceId` namespace:

- `kind: development` is local, bound to one Space and App Project, and has no
  App Release;
- `kind: app` has one App Release and a separate `host: local | hosted`
  placement; and
- kind never changes in place. Publishing and installation create new objects
  and receipts rather than converting a Development Instance.

The complete definitions and journey tests live in
[App platform ontology](app-platform-ontology.md).

## Fixed product and security decisions

1. **Ordinary folders remain the source of truth.** Declaring an App Project
   does not convert, move, upload, or make a Space proprietary. A local App
   Instance does not need to own or live inside a project folder. In 0.4 the
   Project identity and presentation are machine-local application state; no
   portable App Project file is introduced.
2. **Project and runtime ownership are separate.** `projectId` is the local App
   lineage across Releases. An optional `cloudProjectId` is an authenticated
   registry binding. A Principal or optional Organization owns the project-role
   realm. A Tenant owns runtime policy and data, never project source.
3. **Identity never authorizes by possession.** The trusted host derives Space,
   Project, Tenant, Runtime Instance, Feature Installation, Data Namespace, and
   effective Principal context. A renderer, worker, client, or copied manifest
   cannot choose its authority scope.
4. **Review, publication, installation, and authority remain separate acts.** A
   declaration requests a maximum. Installation starts destinations, resources,
   notifications, connections, and every named automation off.
5. **Immutable bytes and live policy remain separate.** The App Release digest
   covers its closed executable and evidence graph. Review, signature, scan,
   registry, delisting, block-launch, and incident records are append-only
   attestations or mutable policy sidecars over that digest. Hosts evaluate both
   closure and current sidecars at publish, install/deploy, launch/activation,
   and authority-lease boundaries.
6. **Installation incarnation and data lineage are different identities.** A
   reviewed update preserves `featureInstallationId`; remove/reinstall creates a
   new value. Mutable data uses `dataNamespaceId`, which can be retained,
   migrated, adopted, exported, or purged only through an explicit receipted
   lifecycle action and is never revived implicitly.
7. **Authority is durably fenced by domain.** Dispatches and effects carry one
   typed `AuthorityStamp` with runtime-instance, feature-installation, grant,
   connection, job, principal, and data generations. Authoritative brokers
   recheck the relevant current fields immediately before effects and commits;
   cancellation alone is insufficient.
8. **Runtime access policy is host-enforced.** Principal-private and role-shared
   data collections and role-bound actions are checked from the host-resolved
   Principal and current roles at operation and commit boundaries. UI hints and
   Feature JavaScript never authorize them.
9. **Connection ownership is explicit.** Instance-owned service connections and
   Principal-owned personal connections have distinct consent, unattended-use,
   transfer, deletion, and receipt rules. Tenant transfer fences all use,
   disconnects instance connections by default, and never transfers Principal
   connections.
10. **Migrations are a restricted management invocation.** Exact reviewed
    migration and schema digests receive enumerated namespace access, fencing,
    cancellation, and receipts. They inherit no view, action, job, network,
    connection, or notification power by default and preserve Principal-private
    partitions.
11. **Publish is not sync.** Publication, project collaboration, instance-data
    replication, secrets, operational control, and Chat sharing are separate
    protocols. Workspace-owned streams exclude `.pi/`, Chats, raw portable
    identity, Library storage, History internals, credentials, and machine
    state. Third-party folder tools may still copy ordinary hidden content under
    their own settings.
12. **Every accepted effect has one effective Principal.** Human, agent,
    service, and system are the Principal kinds. Feature code is identified by
    Feature Installation and Revision, not as another Principal. Receipts may
    add a delegation or authorizer and bounded non-secret effect attribution.
13. **The runtime broker is semantic, not transport-shaped.** Desktop Electron
    and hosted web adapters implement the same identity, authority, error,
    cancellation, receipt, storage, resource, network, connection, action, job,
    notification, and migration semantics. Electron IPC and a hosted API are
    adapters, not the product contract.
14. **Management remains a separate authenticated plane.** Feature runtime code
    cannot publish, install, approve bytes, grant a power, save a connection,
    enable a job, assign a role, migrate data, or deploy an instance. The current
    same-user CLI protocol remains read-only.

[App platform publication and data contracts](app-platform-publication-data.md).
The portable broker semantics live in
[App platform runtime contract](app-platform-runtime-contract.md).

## Shipped local 0.4 boundary

The desktop implements the first complete local Project-to-Instance journey:

1. One registered source Space owns one machine-local App Project and its
   Development Instance. App Studio explicitly records the App title,
   description, and icon; the first direct preview can seed those values from
   its Feature declaration for migration and compatibility.
2. The existing Chat-bound proposal/install and advanced local-install paths
   create reviewed **Local previews**. They remain source-Space-bound,
   release-less Development Features and never convert in place.
3. **Prepare Release** snapshots every current reviewed preview into a verified
   `workspace-app-release` format-version-2 envelope. Presentation, exact
   Feature artifacts and declarations, dependency inventory, build provenance,
   and inspection evidence are digest-covered and stored durably by
   `releaseDigest` in Workspace application data. The local store enforces a
   four-GiB aggregate byte quota before accepting a new object; an idempotent
   write of an already verified digest remains safe when the quota is full.
4. A prepared Release is not installable. **Publish** is a separate local
   receipt and revalidates that the Development revisions have not changed. It
   does not upload, sign, list, deploy, or grant the Release.
5. Installation preparation durably reserves the operation, Runtime Instance,
   Feature Installation, and Data Namespace identities. Activation re-verifies
   and stages the exact published closure before one registry commit makes the
   new App Instance live in the chosen registered Space. Every external power
   starts off and no Development grant, connection, job, or data transfers.
6. Update and rollback target another published Release from the same Project.
   The deterministic plan is persisted and recomputed before activation. Exact
   unchanged Feature content may retain eligible grants, instance-owned
   connections, jobs, and data; changed content retains the existing Feature
   Installation/Data Namespace but resets grants, connections, and jobs. A
   stricter reset policy is always available.
7. The current local runtime accepts only version-2 restricted-app Features with
   no declared data schema or migrations. It rejects schema-bearing Releases and
   migration execution instead of approximating the transition.
8. Uninstall fences the whole App Instance and requires `retain` or `purge` for
   its local data. Retained namespaces have no live installation authority and
   can be purged later. Source files and separately granted ordinary Space files
   are never removed.

The first placement rule is intentionally small: at most one local App Instance
exists for a `(projectId, target Space)` pair, and no target Space may already
contain a Development preview or installed Feature with the same `featureId`.
The App Instance is attached to the target Space for navigation and file-grant
eligibility, while its Release bytes, mutable data, grants, connections,
schedules, operation journals, and receipts stay in Workspace application data.
Removing either the Project's source Space or an active Instance's target Space
is blocked until the release-backed Instance is uninstalled. Retaining data
keeps the source registered until that data is explicitly purged; it does not
keep the former target registered. Once nothing remains live or retained,
removing the source also removes its machine-local Project, Development
Instance, and Release lineage, then safely reconciles unreferenced Release-store
objects. A transient reconciliation failure is retried before later App
mutations and at startup. Startup still fails closed when a referenced object or
security invariant cannot be validated, but a validated orphan that is merely
locked remains inert and pending without preventing Workspace from opening.
Removing a target cancels prepared operations aimed at that Space.

App Studio may also explicitly delete an individual prepared or published
Release after proving it is unused. Deletion is blocked while any active Runtime
Instance, prepared operation (including both its source and target Release), or
retained-data record requires the Release. The lifecycle record is committed
away before safe content-addressed pruning; an interrupted physical cleanup is
therefore inert and retried rather than restoring authority.

## Product language

The friendly surface uses **Space** while a person works locally and the App's
own name while they use an installed or hosted experience. **App Project**,
**Release**, and **Instance** appear only where build, publish, update,
environment, ownership, or recovery decisions require precision. **Feature** is
builder/admin language; its meaningful contributed page or action name is
primary for end users. **Runtime Instance**, **Feature Installation**, **Data
Namespace**, **Tenant**, **Principal**, governance enums, and **Package** remain
internal or advanced diagnostic language.

The version-2 `agent-app.json` UI and package contract remains the Feature
authoring format. Its direct-preview surface is called **Local preview**;
App Studio owns Project, Release, installation, update/rollback, uninstall, and
retained-data decisions. This does not rename Spaces or merge restricted Apps
into native Pi Extensions.

## Implementation order

The local milestones were implemented additively in this order:

1. add cross-implementation canonical declaration and artifact digest fixtures;
2. add transport-neutral opaque identifiers, Runtime Instance context,
   `AuthorityStamp`, stable errors, and receipt types alongside current records;
3. migrate the local registry to explicit Development Instance, Feature
   Installation, Data Namespace, and durable generation records without losing
   the example App's state;
4. separate artifact storage, installation records, authority resolution,
   connection records, receipts, scheduling coordination, and runtime adapters
   behind the existing narrow brokers;
5. migrate storage, connections, schedules, and receipts to the new identities
   with effect-time fencing and owner-class rules; and
6. add an offline release assembler/verifier plus atomic local App Instance
   install/update planning before any server becomes authoritative; and
7. expose the contracts through App Studio with a durable Release store,
   separately receipted prepare/publish, persisted install/update operations,
   activation revalidation, rollback, and explicit uninstall data disposition.

The first hosted milestone is deliberately private and narrow:

> Publish one reviewed local App Project to one private hosted App Instance,
> separately grant one declared destination, bind one explicit connection,
> enable and run one named automation, show its receipt, review an update's
> authority transition, and revoke access.

It requires authenticated Principals, separate Project and Tenant role realms,
an immutable artifact registry, one hosted data/secret service, the semantic
broker adapter, durable scheduling with leases and fencing, and a bounded audit
projection. It does not require generalized folder sync, public discovery, an
App Store, mobile packaging, arbitrary long-running services, or exactly-once
jobs.

### Implemented local product boundary

The local milestone above is exposed through Capabilities and the Space-bound
App Studio tab. It includes language-neutral declaration and artifact vectors
checked by two code-independent executables, strict opaque identities and
seven-domain authority, registry migration to
Project/Development-Instance/installation/data records, effect-time host
fencing, restart-retried cleanup, authority-captured receipts, a durable
immutable Release assembler/verifier/store, and deterministic local App
Instance install/update/rollback activation. Prepared operations survive a
restart until they are activated or cancelled; activation rechecks the exact
Release and durable plan before making authority live.

This boundary is local only. Project presentation is machine-local, Releases
are stored on this device, “published” means eligible for local installation,
and the installed App Instance is attached to one registered Space. There is no
Workspace account, upload, cloud registry, hosted runtime, public listing, App
Store, folder sync, or cross-device App synchronization in 0.4.

The private hosted journey is implemented as an executable semantic core with
injected durable compare-and-swap state, scheduler/lease, vault, and egress
contracts. Its tests cover separate Project/cloud-Project and Tenant roles,
review and publication, deployment, default-off grants, an exact instance-owned
connection, a named job and receipt, compatible update, effect-time revocation,
role/principal/instance data, export, delete, purge, restart, and cleanup
recovery using Connected inbox and community-garden fixtures. It is not a
deployed Workspace service. Production database, scheduler worker, secret
vault, egress, authenticated transport, deployment, operations, and UI adapters
remain future work; this first slice also rejects Feature-set, schema, or data
policy migrations instead of pretending to support them.

## Evidence gates

The four semantic paper gates are accepted as the design contract. The required
lease, cadence/clock, and offline-expiry experiments have also passed; see
[App platform runtime spike evidence](app-platform-runtime-spike-evidence.md)
for the demonstrated invariants and honest limits.

- **Gate 1:** ontology, identities, ownership, local no-account forms, and the
  eleven journeys;
- **Gate 2:** publication closure, provenance, review/publication separation,
  per-Feature continuity, and response states;
- **Gate 3:** data owner classes, connections, Development Instance writes,
  migrations, retention/export/deletion, and explicit non-sync boundaries; and
- **Gate 4:** portable broker authority, receipts, scheduling, revocation,
  offline leases, abuse controls, operator boundaries, and host adapters.

Their acceptance criteria gate the product scope that depends on them; they are
not a claim that every future-hosting criterion shipped in the local foundation
release. The local milestone requires canonical digest conformance, explicit
identity migration, effect-time stale-authority tests, offline Release and
migration planning, restart-safe cleanup, bounded receipts, the Connected inbox
and community-garden subsets, and the disposable lease/clock/offline-expiry
evidence. A production hosted product additionally requires the still-open
Principal-owned connection/delegation, migration execution, Development
publish-input commit, restore/tombstone, retention/region/operator, shared-host
conformance, and real durable-adapter evidence listed in the supporting gates.
No public listing, generalized sync, or hosted-product claim may outrun those
criteria.

## Compatibility posture

Workspace remains an early App-platform product and the checked-in example is
the only first-party Space app, so preserving an accidental internal schema is
not a product goal. We may replace registry and manifest internals when that
materially improves the model. We still require explicit migration and
fail-closed handling because installed local data already matters and those are
the same mechanics future user data will depend on; we do not carry forward
confusing concepts merely for compatibility theater.
