# Workspace visual system

Workspace uses a quiet desktop-tool aesthetic. The interface should feel native, legible, and deliberate before it feels customizable.

## Information hierarchy

- A **Space** is a root folder. It is selected or switched; it is not a peer navigation surface.
- **Files** is the first working surface inside the selected Space.
- Primary surfaces are Files, Capabilities, Chats, Library, and History.
- Provider, model, and authentication controls live in Settings under Assistant; Assistant is not a rail group.
- The first rail item opens the Space manager and identifies the selected root folder. The persistent header above the left pane repeats that Space identity; the selected rail item identifies the current surface.

## Iconography

- Use Fluent System Icons for shell navigation, commands, status, and empty states.
- Use regular icons at rest and the matching filled icon for a selected navigation item.
- Use 16px icons for inline actions, 24px for the icon-only rail navigation, 20px for section markers, and no more than 24px for empty states. The root Space identity glyph is a deliberate 26px exception because it anchors the larger 90px identity band rather than an ordinary navigation row.
- Material file-type icons are the one deliberate exception because file recognition benefits from familiar type colors.
- Do not mix icon libraries within one control group. The Space glyph may repeat only where it communicates inherited root context: the root selector, switcher, cards, and Space-bound tabs. The banner itself is name-first and does not repeat the rail glyph.
- Space color may appear as a small avatar accent or active indicator, never as a frame around the application.

## Typography and spacing

- The default is Segoe UI Variable Text with 15px body copy and weights 400, 600, and 700.
- User-selected fonts and text sizes may change type, but must not change shell geometry or push controls out of bounds.
- Use the 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 32px spacing scale.
- Controls are 36–40px tall with 4–8px radii.
- Avoid all-caps labels, weight 800+, text shadows, ornamental whole-app gradients, and oversized hero headers.

## Layout

- Desktop rail navigation is icon-only: centered square targets (44–48px) with 24px Fluent icons, tooltips and accessible names carrying the labels, and one subtle selected state (soft fill plus a small accent pill). Narrow layouts return to horizontal rows with text labels.
- Every left-pane surface begins with the same 90px identity band in the same position. Its centered, name-only lockup represents the selected Space, not the active page. The desktop root Space selector is a compact icon-only tile centered in that band while the adjacent pane header carries the full Space name; narrow layouts return the selector to a horizontal icon-and-name lockup. Files, Capabilities, Chats, Library, and History keep the quick Space switcher, while the Spaces-management surface omits that redundant switcher.
- Space banners stay inside the identity header and appearance previews. They do not wallpaper the right work surface or recolor structural borders; interaction color and shell structure remain part of the global application system.
- Color and icon identity inherit through Space-bound cards, chat groups, tabs, surfaces, and chat empty states. Content belonging to another Space carries that Space's own identity rather than the currently selected one.
- User Chat bubbles use one solid primary Space accent, never a gradient between accent colors. Assistant message headers are text-only and do not repeat a decorative Assistant avatar.
- Forms use stacked labels and hints with an explicit action row.
- Notices use `icon | copy | action` and stack only when their own pane becomes narrow.
- Empty states are centered, restrained, and no wider than 440px.
- Resizable panes must adapt to their own width; prefer container queries to viewport-only breakpoints.

## Windows material

- Use Mica only on Windows 11 22H2 or newer (build 22621+) and only when the operating system does not report reduced transparency.
- When Mica is active, keep the titlebar overlay transparent and make only the root window chrome, rail, and pane gutters transparent. Content surfaces remain opaque so hierarchy and contrast do not depend on the wallpaper.
- The preload reports `window.material` and `main.tsx` applies `data-window-material="mica"` synchronously before React's first paint. Do not move this to a passive effect that produces a solid-background flash.
- Older Windows builds and reduced-transparency sessions use a theme-matched solid background. Light, dark, and system theme changes must update native chrome and the renderer together.

## Visual acceptance

Before a handoff, exercise every primary surface and every Settings section in light and dark themes at 1440×900, 1280×800, and a tall/narrow desktop window. Reject the candidate for:

- overlapping or concatenated copy;
- clipped labels or controls;
- horizontal page overflow;
- full-width buttons without an intentional form layout;
- mixed shell icon weights or sizes;
- repeated decorative identity graphics;
- empty states that leave unexplained split-pane chrome;
- focus, hover, active, and disabled states that are not visually distinct.

For Electron-integrated changes, repeat a packaged-app pass that confirms Mica or its solid fallback, light/dark/system transitions, custom menus, updater state, and the minimum window size. Browser fixtures cannot prove native material or titlebar behavior.

## Appearance scopes

- **Settings → Appearance** controls the application theme, font, and text size.
- **Customize Space** controls one Space's accent, compact banner, and Fluent identity icon.
- Customize Space is opened from the Space card and lives in one right-side appearance tab per Space. Changes repaint every identity consumer immediately.
- Per-Space appearance is personal application state. It is not written into the user's ordinary folder and does not travel with shared files.
- A custom image is resized and compressed before local storage. Unsafe image formats and malformed stored values are rejected.
- Every Space appearance control updates a live preview, saves immediately, and offers a single Reset action.
