# macOS release runbook

This runbook publishes the Apple silicon Workspace artifacts to the separate public feed at [`Mat-Tom-Son/workspace-mac-releases`](https://github.com/Mat-Tom-Son/workspace-mac-releases). Windows artifacts continue to use the source repository's releases. Both platforms use the same `package.json` version.

## One-time workstation setup

1. Install the `Developer ID Application: James Thompson (464JD5K8DC)` certificate and private key in the login Keychain.
2. Store notarization credentials with `xcrun notarytool store-credentials`. The existing local profile is `kai-workspace-notary`; profile names are not product-scoped.
3. Create ignored `.env.macos.local` using the non-secret variable template in [macOS build and release lane](macos-build.md).
4. Confirm `gh auth status` uses the `Mat-Tom-Son` account and that the Mac feed repository is public.

Do not export or commit the certificate, private key, app-specific password, or notary credentials.

## Release procedure

1. Sync `main`, complete the shared version bump/release notes, and finish the Windows/source-repository work for that version.
2. Run the normal gates with Node 24:

   ```bash
   npm ci
   npm run check
   npm test
   ```

3. Confirm the worktree is clean and `HEAD` is pushed to `origin/main`.
4. Build, verify, and publish in one command:

   ```bash
   npm run desktop:release:mac
   ```

5. Confirm the command reports a public, non-draft `v<version>` release. It must contain the DMG, ZIP, both blockmaps, `latest-mac.yml`, checksums, and both release manifests.
6. Install or update the app, then verify the exact installed bundle:

   ```bash
   npm run desktop:verify:installed:mac
   ```

7. Open Workspace normally and check **Settings > About** and **Workspace > Check for Updates...**.

The publisher refuses a dirty/unpushed source tree, a source tag that does not point at the exact release commit, a missing/draft/incomplete Windows source release, a private Mac feed, an existing Mac tag, an unsigned manifest, a missing asset, or any remote size/digest mismatch. It uploads a draft first and publishes only after every Mac asset's GitHub SHA-256 matches the local file.

## Updater evidence

Repeat a lower-version-to-current installed update whenever updater code, Electron, Electron Builder, signing identity, bundle id, feed, artifact names, or Squirrel.Mac behavior changes.

The accepted proof must show:

- the lower app is Developer ID-signed, notarized, stapled, and installed under `/Applications`;
- `Contents/Resources/app-update.yml` names `Mat-Tom-Son/workspace-mac-releases`;
- the lower app's update command offers the expected higher version and the Settings update surface reports the same state (version 0.2.9 uses **Help > Check for Updates...**; version 0.2.10 and later use **Workspace > Check for Updates...** with a native dialog);
- the cached ZIP SHA-256 equals the published GitHub asset digest;
- Workspace shuts down, replaces the app, and relaunches at the higher version;
- `npm run desktop:verify:installed:mac` passes;
- a full quit and reopen does not ask for repeated Keychain passwords.

Workspace 0.2.8 to 0.2.9 and 0.2.9 to 0.2.10 passed this proof on July 15, 2026. For 0.2.10, the installed 0.2.9 app discovered the public release, cached the final updater ZIP with SHA-256 `35f359e4042a0feaccd75feaca18ab0064d1c85b2500ee99295fdab773c62234`, replaced and relaunched `/Applications/Workspace.app`, passed installed-bundle verification, preserved the empty Space registry, survived last-window close/reopen in one process, and completed a full quit/reopen without a SecurityAgent or Keychain dialog. `updateNow()` intentionally downloads and restarts from one user action.

## Recovery rules

- Never replace assets in a published release. Correct a bad release with a higher shared version.
- A failed draft may be deleted only after confirming it was never published or consumed by an installed app.
- If a build fails after the DMG was notarized, rerun the finalizer. It detects an already valid signed/stapled DMG and refreshes only updater metadata.
- Never rename or install `Workspace Local Smoke.app` over the production app. A user-data override does not isolate Keychain; use the signed candidate or a disposable macOS account for interactive testing.
- If repeated Keychain prompts occur after replacing an old ad hoc build, quit Workspace and run `npm run desktop:reset:mac-safe-storage -- --yes --reopen`. Do not read the secret with `security ... -g`.
- The current public lane is arm64 only. Do not publish x64 until an Intel Mac passes launch and updater smoke.

## Release ownership

The source repository owns code, Windows releases, issues, and documentation. `workspace-mac-releases` is an artifact feed only. Do not develop or hand-edit release metadata in the feed repository, and do not add a second tag workflow that competes with the Windows publisher.
