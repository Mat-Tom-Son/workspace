# macOS build and release lane

Workspace uses one Electron, React, local API, Pi, management-kernel, restricted-app, and versioning codebase on Windows and macOS. macOS is a platform lane in this repository, not a fork.

## Production baseline

The Apple silicon lane was verified on July 15, 2026 against Workspace 0.2.9:

- TypeScript checks and the complete 246-test suite pass.
- Desktop preparation passes, including the native Pi resource preflight and real-Electron restricted-app sandbox probe.
- Electron Builder produces an arm64 app, DMG, ZIP, both blockmaps, `latest-mac.yml`, checksums, and machine-readable/text release manifests.
- The app and DMG are Developer ID-signed by Team `464JD5K8DC`, use hardened runtime, are notarized and stapled, and are accepted by Gatekeeper.
- The packaged app uses bundle id `io.github.mattomson.workspace`, the custom icon, native macOS menus, and the complete renderer and CLI payload.
- The Mac update feed is the public artifact-only repository [`Mat-Tom-Son/workspace-mac-releases`](https://github.com/Mat-Tom-Son/workspace-mac-releases). Windows remains on [`Mat-Tom-Son/workspace`](https://github.com/Mat-Tom-Son/workspace/releases).
- A signed/notarized installed 0.2.8 app discovered 0.2.9, exposed the rendered `Download Workspace 0.2.9` control, downloaded the public ZIP, installed it, and relaunched as 0.2.9. The updater-cache SHA-256 matched the published asset digest exactly.
- After removing the obsolete ad hoc `Workspace Safe Storage` item once, two cold launches under the stable Developer ID identity completed without Keychain password prompts.

This proof enables automatic updates in signed production macOS builds with an embedded `app-update.yml`. The ad hoc package lane may retain the manifest for structural verification, but it uses the distinct `Workspace Local Smoke` name, `io.github.mattomson.workspace.local-smoke` bundle id, build channel, and application-data directory; its runtime never starts the updater or contacts the production feed.

## Toolchain

Use Node 24 for repeatable release evidence. Node 22.19.0 or newer is supported for development.

```bash
npm ci
npm run check
npm test
npm run desktop:make:mac
```

`desktop:make:mac` is the unsigned/ad hoc structural smoke lane. It performs desktop preparation, Pi and restricted-app smoke checks, Electron Builder DMG/ZIP assembly, packaged-asset and fuse verification, updater-manifest verification, mounted-DMG inspection, checksum generation, and release-manifest generation. It is not distributable and must not be renamed or installed over the production app.

Expected Apple silicon outputs:

- `out/builder/mac-arm64/Workspace Local Smoke.app`
- `out/builder/Workspace-<version>-mac-arm64.dmg`
- `out/builder/Workspace-<version>-mac-arm64.zip`
- matching `.blockmap` files
- `out/builder/latest-mac.yml`
- `out/builder/SHA256SUMS-mac.txt`
- `out/builder/Workspace-mac-release-manifest.json`
- `out/builder/Workspace-mac-release-manifest.txt`

Use `-- --arch x64` after a build command when an Intel candidate is required. An Intel artifact is not releasable until it receives a real Intel launch and updater smoke.

## Interactive packaged smoke

Do not interactively launch an ad hoc candidate under a normal macOS account. An ad hoc app using the production identity can invalidate Keychain access control and cause password prompts even when `WORKSPACE_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR` points at `/tmp`; the profile override does not isolate Keychain. The checked-in smoke lane's distinct name and bundle id prevent it from impersonating production, but routine ad hoc verification remains non-interactive.

Use a Developer ID-signed candidate for interactive checks on the release workstation:

```bash
WORKSPACE_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR=/tmp/workspace-macos-smoke \
  out/builder/mac-arm64/Workspace.app/Contents/MacOS/Workspace
```

That production-name path exists only after `npm run desktop:make:mac:release`; the ad hoc executable is `out/builder/mac-arm64/Workspace Local Smoke.app/Contents/MacOS/Workspace Local Smoke`. Exercise onboarding, Space creation/registration, Files, Capabilities, Chats, Library, History, Settings, native file actions, restricted apps, menus, window close/reopen, and sleep/wake continuity. The profile override isolates CLI requests, app files, restricted-app state, and preferences, but it is not a Keychain boundary. A separate disposable macOS account is the alternative for interactive ad hoc testing.

The packaged CLI can be tested directly:

```bash
WORKSPACE_DESKTOP_USER_DATA_DIR=/tmp/workspace-macos-smoke \
WORKSPACE_CLI_APP="$PWD/out/builder/mac-arm64/Workspace.app/Contents/MacOS/Workspace" \
  out/builder/mac-arm64/Workspace.app/Contents/bin/workspace context --json
```

The app adds `Contents/bin` to child-process `PATH`. A DMG must not edit a person's shell profile; making `workspace` available to unrelated Terminal sessions remains an explicit installation action.

## Signing configuration

The ignored `.env.macos.local` file is the normal workstation configuration:

```dotenv
WORKSPACE_MAC_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: James Thompson (464JD5K8DC)"
APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE="kai-workspace-notary"
WORKSPACE_MAC_RELEASE_OWNER="Mat-Tom-Son"
WORKSPACE_MAC_RELEASE_REPO="workspace-mac-releases"
WORKSPACE_MAC_TEAM_ID="464JD5K8DC"
```

The notary profile name is local and arbitrary; the existing profile is valid for both products. Never commit Apple passwords, API keys, certificate private keys, or exported identities. `APPLE_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE` may be replaced by a complete App Store Connect API-key or Apple-ID environment set when needed.

Build a signed candidate without publishing:

```bash
npm run desktop:make:mac:release
```

The release lane signs/notarizes the app, signs/notarizes/staples the final DMG, then regenerates the DMG blockmap and `latest-mac.yml` checksum after those byte-changing operations. Strict verification requires the expected Developer ID team, hardened runtime, stapling, Gatekeeper acceptance, feed, manifest, CLI, DMG layout, and exact artifact hashes.

## Public releases

Normal releases use one package version across Windows and Mac, but separate artifact feeds so the two publishers cannot race to own one GitHub release:

```bash
npm run desktop:release:mac
```

The publisher requires a clean worktree whose `HEAD` equals `origin/main`, the matching source tag and complete public Windows release, a public feed repository, and an unused `v<version>` tag in that feed. It verifies the local release again, uploads all assets as a draft, checks remote names, sizes, and GitHub digests, then publishes the release as latest. There is no dirty-worktree bypass.

See [macOS release runbook](macos-release.md) for the exact repeatable procedure and recovery rules.

## Keychain behavior

Provider and restricted-app credentials use Electron `safeStorage`, backed by Keychain. Stable Developer ID signing gives macOS one durable requester identity. An older ad hoc app that reused the production name may leave a Safe Storage access-control entry that repeatedly asks for a password after migration. Current local smoke builds use `Workspace Local Smoke`, a separate bundle id and application-data directory, and never start the production updater; do not rename them to `Workspace.app`.

Only when repeated prompts are observed, quit Workspace and run:

```bash
npm run desktop:reset:mac-safe-storage -- --yes --reopen
```

The helper deletes only the `Workspace Safe Storage` key and encrypted provider/restricted-app credential blobs. Spaces, chats, History, preferences, and ordinary app data remain. Users may need to enter provider or app credentials again.

Do not diagnose this with `security find-generic-password ... -g`: `-g` requests the secret and can itself trigger a password prompt. The installed-app verifier deliberately reads no Keychain secret data.
