# Product model and roadmap

This document is the durable product brief for Workspace. It exists so design, implementation, and release decisions stay aligned as the app grows.

## Product promise

Workspace makes an ordinary folder understandable as a place for getting something done, then gives that place a capable Assistant.

Many people already have the right raw material—folders, files, cloud-synchronized directories, and repeatable ways of working—but do not think of a folder as an environment they can return to. A **Space** closes that gap. It adds a human mental model and an Assistant without turning the folder into a proprietary format.

Workspace is for general computer work. Coding is one valid use, not the organizing metaphor.

## The nouns

| Concept | User promise | Boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **Workspace** | The desktop product that brings places, conversations, materials, and an Assistant together. | It is not the name of each folder-backed activity. |
| **Space** | One understandable place for an activity, backed by an ordinary folder. | Registering a folder does not move or convert it. |
| **Files** | The ordinary folder contents visible for the selected Space. | Files are not a separate container or proprietary format. |
| **Chats** | Conversations grounded in the selected Space. | A chat does not automatically receive every file in the Space. |
| **Library** | Personal materials worth reusing across Spaces. | Items are passive and are copied explicitly; they are not prompt context. |
| **History** | Checkpoints and recoverable changes associated with a Space. | It should remain distinct from chat history. |
| **Assistant** | The Pi-powered helper. | Its provider and model are configured in Settings, independently from Space content. |
| **Capabilities** | One place to discover and manage what the Assistant can do. | It groups Skills and Extensions; it is not another runtime or package format. |
| **Skill** | A reusable way of working that helps the Assistant approach a task. | A Skill may contain executable scripts and is not merely a document. |
| **Extension** | An executable capability or connection available to the Assistant. | It has a stronger trust implication than a Library item. |

The Space switcher chooses the active root-folder entity. The stable primary navigation then follows these surface nouns:

- **Files**
- **Capabilities**
- **Chats**
- **Library**
- **History**

The Assistant's model provider, model, API key, and supported provider OAuth connection live in **Settings → Assistant**, rather than adding a setup destination to the primary rail. A restricted Space app's connection is a different, app-scoped object managed with that app in **Capabilities**.

Each open tab belongs to one Space. Selecting a tab takes the user back to that Space and its identity; selecting a Space restores its most recent tab. A Chat that is working remains alive when another tab is selected, when Workspace is minimized, and when the window is hidden to the tray.

## A Space is a view of a folder, not a new file format

There are two honest ways to create a Space:

1. **Create a Space:** Workspace creates a normal folder under its managed local content location.
2. **Turn an existing folder into a Space:** Workspace registers the folder in place.

Both routes should lead to the same product experience. Registration must not move, duplicate, or rename user files. Workspace adds one intentionally narrow, hidden metadata layer: `.workspace/space.json` preserves the Space identity when its folder moves, and `.workspace/conversations/` keeps that Space's Chats with it. The Files and History surfaces hide this directory. Provider credentials, the Space registry, History objects, Pi sessions, ignore rules, and other machine-specific app state remain in application storage. Portable executable Pi configuration remains separate under `.pi/`. Creating or registering the Space is the user's authorization for Workspace to load that local configuration; removing the Space revokes that authorization.

A Space may also have a personal visual identity: accent colors, a compact banner, and a Fluent icon. Those preferences help distinguish Spaces inside Workspace, but they currently remain application state on this computer. The versioned `space.json` schema can grow deliberately if portable appearance is introduced later; current code must not smuggle machine-specific state into it.

The user should always be able to reveal a Space in the operating system, open its files with other applications, back it up normally, or synchronize it with a desktop sync tool. A Google Drive for desktop folder works because it is a local folder; that is not the same as direct Google Drive API integration.

## Context is explicit

Registering a folder is also the host authorization for its existing local Pi configuration. Assistant context, new package installation, restricted-app permissions, and external connections remain separate states:

| Action | What changes | What does not happen implicitly |
|---|---|---|
| Register a folder as a Space | The folder appears in Workspace and its local Pi configuration may load. | Files are not uploaded or converted, and local code is not certified as safe. |
| Add a Library item to a Space | An independent copy is written under `From Library`. | The original is not changed and the copy is not attached to a chat. |
| Attach a file to a Chat | That file is made available to the conversation. | Other Space files are not included automatically. |
| Install a personal Skill or Extension | It becomes available through the user's Pi scope. | It is not copied into every Space. |
| Ask the Assistant to build a Space app | The Assistant may write an ordinary restricted-app package and ask Workspace to inspect it for review. | A proposal does not execute or install code, grant network access, or store a credential. |
| Install a reviewed Space app | The exact reviewed digest becomes available in that Space. | Network destinations, Space files, notification categories, saved connections, and every named automation remain off. |
| Allow one app destination, file root, or notification category | That exact reviewed declaration becomes usable by the installed digest. | Other declarations, saved connections, automations, and other Spaces receive no authority. |
| Save or remove an app connection | Workspace adds or deletes one operating-system-encrypted credential binding for that Space, app digest, destination, and origin. | Destination access is not implicitly granted, and deleting the local record does not revoke the credential at its provider. |
| Enable one app automation | Workspace may run that reviewed named job on its bounded schedule while Workspace is running. | Other jobs stay off, and this run receives only the intersection of current grants and its reviewed permission subset. |
| Run an app automation now | Workspace runs that named job once and records a durable receipt, even if its schedule is off. | It does not enable or shift the schedule; a disabled job has no notification authority. |

This separation is a core product rail. “Available,” “in this Space,” “in this chat,” and “allowed to execute” must never collapse into one invisible state.

## Assistant model

Workspace hosts Pi instead of recreating an agent framework. Pi owns model/provider behavior, built-in tools, standard resource discovery, packages, Skills, Extensions, and project trust mechanics. Workspace supplies the desktop experience: setup, catalog surfaces, secure credential persistence, folder selection, the registered-Space authorization override, extension UI bridges, and clear execution/permission explanations.

There are two capability scopes:

- **Personal:** available across Spaces from the user's Pi agent directory.
- **This Space:** portable configuration stored under the Space's `.pi/` directory and authorized while the folder is registered as a Space.

The **Capabilities** surface unifies discovery and management without erasing the distinctions that matter. It identifies whether an item is a Skill or Extension, Personal or This Space, active or merely available, direct-imported or package-provided, and healthy or diagnostic-failing. Installed items can be searched, filtered by type and scope, and sorted by name, type, scope, or source. Discover results can be searched, filtered, and sorted by first-party/reference status, downloads, recency, or name.

Packages can distribute Skills, Extensions, prompts, themes, and related Pi resources. They remain installation and lifecycle plumbing; the primary UI should describe the capability a person is gaining, show inspected resource types and lifecycle scripts when registry metadata is available, and label unavailable details as unknown rather than absent. A package that includes Extensions or install scripts is a code-execution decision and must not be presented as a harmless Skill-only import. See [Assistant capabilities](assistant-capabilities.md) for the complete compatibility and safety model.

Workspace has two deliberately different executable lanes inside the broader Extension product concept:

| Lane | Trust and distribution | UI and authority |
|---|---|---|
| Native Pi Extension | Standard Pi package/resource locations; full current-user execution after Personal install or Space registration. | May add Pi tools, commands, providers, events, and a static host-rendered `surface.json` contribution. Its code owns its network and operating-system access. |
| Restricted Space app | A complete, Space-local reviewed-web package proposed by the Assistant or selected through advanced local install. It never enters Pi's package manager or loaded catalog. | Runs reviewed UI and worker code in separate sandboxed Electron hosts. Tabs, network, storage, files, connections, notifications, and named automations exist only through narrow host contracts. |

The model experiences either lane as a package-shaped capability, but the product must not flatten their execution boundaries. Native Pi compatibility remains the full-trust ecosystem lane; restricted apps are the flexible app canvas for generated inboxes, dashboards, extractors, project-service panels, and other Space-specific tools. See [Restricted app authoring](restricted-app-authoring.md) and [Restricted app runtime](restricted-app-runtime.md).

## Management layer

Workspace also needs a semantic layer above its individual screens so the same product can be understood by the renderer, command line, scripts, Pi, and eventually a higher-level Assistant. `WorkspaceKernel` is that shared in-process read authority. It resolves actor context to the most-specific Space, exposes versioned snapshots of registered Spaces and running Assistant work, and projects Pi's authoritative capability catalog without creating another registry.

The installed `workspace` command is the first adapter over that layer. It can report context, Spaces, active Assistant turns and compactions, and available Skills, Extensions, tools, packages, prompts, themes, and commands in human or stable JSON form. The current protocol is deliberately read-only and content-free. It does not authorize the Assistant to mutate Spaces, files, capabilities, tabs, panes, or application settings.

This is infrastructure over the existing nouns, not a new user-facing concept. A future cross-Space Assistant and controlled Space runtimes should build on the same typed actor, scope, task, and capability contracts instead of scraping renderer state or bypassing domain policy. See [Workspace management layer](management-layer.md) for the exact contract and security boundary.

## Product rails

When a design is ambiguous, prefer the option that best preserves these properties:

1. **Local first:** core work does not require an account or cloud service.
2. **Ordinary files:** user content stays portable and directly accessible.
3. **Clear language:** expose the Space mental model before filesystem or package-manager jargon.
4. **Explicit context:** people can tell what the Assistant can see in the current chat.
5. **Layered authorization:** Space registration authorizes local Pi configuration; package installation, restricted-app permissions, connections, and Chat context stay explicit and separately revocable.
6. **Pi compatibility:** use standard Pi behavior and formats instead of parallel Workspace-only systems.
7. **Capability transparency:** show source, scope, status, and diagnostics for executable additions.
8. **Provider neutrality:** cloud and model integrations should use replaceable adapters rather than shape the core model.

## Roadmap and known gaps

### Foundation now

- Create a folder-backed Space or register an existing folder without conversion.
- Rename a Space, remove a linked-folder registration without deleting its files, or delete a managed Space with an explicit destructive warning.
- Browse and upload Space files, run Space-scoped Chats, use the Library, and view History.
- Restore content-addressed History checkpoints created around file mutations and Assistant turns.
- Configure a Pi provider/model with an API key and use Pi's built-in tools.
- Discover and search Personal and registered-Space Skills and Extensions in one Capabilities surface, with accurate source, scope, load state, and diagnostics.
- Browse curated first-party/reference Skills and Extensions alongside community Pi packages, with type filters and explicit provenance.
- Import standard Skills and compatible skill bundles while preserving their supporting files.
- Install, update, and remove Pi packages at Personal or registered-Space scope.
- Customize each Space with a compact banner, paired accent colors, and a searchable Fluent icon catalog without changing its folder.
- Inspect Space context, registered Spaces, active Assistant/compaction tasks, and Pi capabilities through one versioned `WorkspaceKernel` and the read-only installed `workspace` CLI.
- Drive one real Pi turn through the local API with the harness-neutral `workspace:drive` test driver.
- Render validated declarative `surface.json` contributions from loaded Pi Extensions as a contributed rail destination, left-pane navigator, and Space-bound view tabs without injecting Extension code into the renderer.
- Let the Assistant submit a completed, Space-relative restricted-app package through a host-owned proposal tool. Workspace persists a Space-and-Chat-bound, digest-pinned review without evaluating JavaScript; only a later human approval installs it, with network, Space-file, and notification access off, no saved connection, and every automation disabled.
- Give each installed Space app arbitrary reviewed web UI in a sandboxed rail navigator and host-derived persistent Space-owned right tabs, plus optional bounded Assistant actions and named automations in a separate worker sandbox. A machine-wide scheduler shared across Spaces provides two execution slots, FIFO admission, same-job non-overlap, durable cadence, bounded catch-up, and run receipts. Capabilities manages each job independently alongside exact network/file/notification grants, host-owned encrypted connections, local data, reviewed updates, removal, and the secondary advanced local-package path.
- Provide bounded host-owned JSON storage with active-visible-view invalidation hints, History-covered Space-file grants, exact public-HTTPS or numeric-loopback requests, API-key/bearer/basic/OAuth PKCE connection adapters, and static reviewed Windows notifications from enabled automation runs.
- Build a Windows installer and deliver updates through GitHub Releases.

### Next product layer

- Make Space location, storage ownership, History coverage, and executable capability class easier to inspect at a glance.
- Add Library organization controls such as rename, move, delete, reveal, and bulk operations.
- Add per-resource enable/disable and package filtering controls without confusing availability with activation.
- Add receipts and safe removal for directly imported Skills, independently from package lifecycle.
- Add named-pack selection for Anthropic marketplace bundles instead of importing every discovered Skill in an archive.
- Make “what this Chat can see and use” visible before and during a conversation.
- Add an authenticated, versioned mutation surface with explicit Personal, Space, and Chat scopes, replay protection, confirmations, revocation, and durable action receipts.
- Add event subscriptions and a scoped cross-Space Assistant that can manage the product only through those authorized contracts.
- Add restricted-app remote subscriptions and arbitrary push adapters, finer web-runtime resource controls, and a verified Space-service registry backed by a trusted launcher, per-instance challenge, and process-generation lifecycle. Raw numeric loopback grants remain useful for development but do not prove which process owns a port.
- Strengthen onboarding, keyboard/accessibility behavior, renderer interaction tests, recovery, export, and diagnostics.

### Later adapters and distribution maturity

- Add native provider OAuth only with a complete desktop callback/device-code experience and verified credential handling.
- Add direct cloud-storage integrations behind a provider-neutral model with stable remote IDs, offline behavior, explicit conflicts, and no surprise deletion.
- Move from personal or unsigned Windows artifacts to a publicly trusted code-signing identity.
- Consider additional Windows architectures after the x64 release lane is stable.

Roadmap wording must distinguish shipped behavior from direction. Update this section when a capability moves between layers.

## Decision test

Before adding a new top-level concept, ask:

1. Can it fit cleanly as Space content, a Chat, a Library material, a Skill, or an Extension?
2. Is its scope obvious: personal, one Space, or one Chat?
3. Can a person understand what it can read, change, or execute?
4. Does it preserve normal folders and standard Pi compatibility?
5. Would it still make sense for non-coding computer work?

If those answers are unclear, the feature needs a sharper mental model before it needs another navigation item.
